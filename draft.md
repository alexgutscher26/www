# Project Overview

We are building a Personal Finance SaaS for Gig Workers. This financial management tool is tailored specifically for gig workers and freelancers, helping them manage multiple income streams, set aside taxes, and budget for long-term goals. The project utilizes Next.js 14 with the app router, React TSX, Shadcn, Supabase for the backend, and Clerk for user authentication.

## Frontend

- **Next.js 14**: A React framework for building server-rendered applications and static websites, leveraging the app router for routing.
- **React TSX**: For building the user interface with TypeScript, ensuring type safety and enhanced development experience.
- **Shadcn**: A UI component library that provides pre-designed components for building a polished user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling and responsive design.

## Backend

- **Supabase**: An open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) that provides a PostgreSQL database, authentication, and real-time features.
- **Clerk**: For user authentication and management, providing a secure and easy way to handle user sign-ups, sign-ins, and session management.

## Additional Tools and Libraries

- **Prisma**: An ORM for database management, enabling type-safe database access (optional but beneficial if you need a more complex data structure).
- **React Query**: For data fetching and state management, making it easy to handle server state in your React components.
- **Axios or Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests to external APIs or services.

## DevOps and Deployment

- **Vercel**: For deploying the Next.js application, providing serverless functions and continuous deployment.
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.

## Testing

- **Jest**: For unit testing your JavaScript code.
- **React Testing Library**: For testing React components and ensuring they behave as expected.

## Analytics and Monitoring

- **Google Analytics or Mixpanel**: For tracking user behavior and engagement.
- **Sentry**: For error tracking and monitoring application performance.

## Optional Enhancements

- **Stripe**: For handling payments and subscriptions if you plan to monetize the SaaS.
- **Plaid**: For connecting bank accounts and automatically importing transactions (if integrating with banking services).
